# 5CCS2SEG - Practice Project
The objective of this project is to develop a small website that helps third year (level 6) Computer Science and Computer Science with Management students select their module diet. The website must show students the available modules, with a clear indication of how the module fits in the programme (core, compulsory or optional), the assessment structure of module, the moduleâ€™s credit volume, term(s) and lecturer(s), and a short description of the content. The website should enable students to check whether a module diet is valid for their programme. Ideally, it enables students to generate a module diet that is presented in a concise table, which identifies any errors in the module diet. The website could also suggest modules that fit a particular stream or area of expertise students might wish to focus on. Ideally, such suggestions are provided even if the student does not explicitly selects a stream, but has selected one or more modules belonging to a particular stream. The website must not rely on a backend and run entirely within a web browser.
